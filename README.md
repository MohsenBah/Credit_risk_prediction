Still updating!

## Context

The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. The link to the original dataset can be found below.

## Content

1- Preprocessing: 
It is almost impossible to understand the original dataset due to its complicated system of categories and symbols. Thus, it is needed to do much preprocessing. Moreover, I plan to deploy the final model, so I chose these features.
